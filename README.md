# Java-course-project-hit
Java project which represent 2 games for a single player - "Tic Tac Toe" & "Catch the bunny" <br>
Each game has 2 difficulty levels: <br>
"Random" - the computer will move randomaly without any calculations. <br>
"Smart" - the computer will "think" and  play the best it can (In the Tic Tac Toe game the computer will resolve any possible move
and it will be unbeatable) <br>
In addition to the AI that we are required to implement,<br>
the project also emphasizes the use of Design Patterns and MVC architecture.<br>
